TOY SYNTHESIS
=============

This project combines LEGO WeDo, DUPLO, K'Nex, Construx, littleBits, Arduino, and MIT Scratch into one project. It's an overly complicated synthesis of technology and toys to build a controllable fan with parts lying around my work room.

The two required files are:

* wedo2.ino -- Load this onto the Arduino. It sends out a letter when a button in pressed.

* wedo2.sb -- Run this file from within MIT Scratch. It listens for characters sent through the USB cable and responds accordingly.
